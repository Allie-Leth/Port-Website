# CVE-2025-64756: glob CLI Command Injection
# Severity: HIGH
# Package: glob
# Affected Versions: 10.3.7 - 11.0.x (fixed in 10.5.0, 11.1.0)
#
# WHY THIS DOESN'T AFFECT US:
# - This vulnerability ONLY affects the glob CLI tool when using -c/--cmd options
# - We use glob as a library dependency (via Jest, Tailwind, etc.), NOT as a CLI tool
# - The library API (glob(), globSync(), and iterators) is explicitly NOT vulnerable
# - We never execute `glob -c` or `glob --cmd` commands in our codebase or CI/CD
# - Our usage is limited to programmatic file pattern matching via the library API
#
# DECISION: Safe to ignore - CLI-only vulnerability with no impact on library usage
# DATE: 2025-11-23
# ISSUE: See GitLab issue for full investigation and rationale
